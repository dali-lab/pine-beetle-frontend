## Project Overview
Project Pine Beetle is a web application that visualizes data on Southern Pine Beetle outbreaks in 16 states across the US. This tool uses a predictive model to predict future outbreaks and movements of Southern Pine Beetles.

On the front-end, this application provides valuable information for USFS researchers and state forest rangers to see information related to past outbreaks and predictions about future outbreaks. This application also provides information to the general public about threats facing their communities.

On the back-end, this application aggregates data collected from USFS and state forest rangers on outbreaks and beetle counts, then uses those values to display historical data and future predictions. The predictive model used to generate predictions is written in R. All data is stored in a NoSQL database, allowing for easy pre and post-processing. Using an Express server, all calculations are made in JavaScript (outside of the predictive model), and all data is stored in JSON format.

Project Pine Beetle is a collaboration between Professor Matt Ayres of Dartmouth College, Professor Carissa Aoki of Bates College, the United States Forest Service (USFS), and the Dartmouth Applied Learning and Innovation (DALI) Lab.

## Project Architecture
### Front-end
The front-end of this application is a public interface for users to view pine beetle infestation predictions and spot/trapping data from previous years. The data is visualized with a series of maps and graphs. Maps are generated using [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), and graphs are generated using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

The site can be viewed at https://pine-beetle-prediction.surge.sh. As of March 2019, the web application consists of four primary pages. With future development, we hope to expand the interface further to provide more functionality and data to users. These pages are as follows:

#### Home Page:
Simple landing page to direct users across the site.

#### About Page:
Displays descriptions about the project and its partners, as well as high-level information about the risk of pine beetle outbreaks nationwide.

#### Historical Data Page:
Pulls data from the database for analysis and visualization. All data viewed on this page is on previous years. Users can filter by year range, state, and forest. Data visualiation is based on a geographic level as well as a year-by-year level. This page is mostly useful for viewing trends in beetle movements in previous years.

#### Predictive Model Page:
Runs the predictive model to generate predictions about future outbreaks on a state and forest level. Users select a year to run the model on as well as a state. Predictions come in the following format: probability of seeing 0 spots (outbreaks), probability of at least 1 spot, probability of at least 20 spots, probability of at least 54 spots, probability of at least 148 spots, probability of at least 403 spots, and probability of at least 1096 spots. These values form a probabilistic distribution by an inverse logarithmic function. Predictions are generated with a linear regression forming a Poisson distribution.

Predictions come in for each forest in the state and can be viewed on a distribution plot as well as a choropleth map showing outbreaks by geographical forest/county.

### Back-end

	- `brew install node` (you will need version >=9.x and <= 10.x)
		- Note: for advanced usage, we also recommend installing Node.js via a version manager such as [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) instead of with homebrew. To do so, run `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash`. Be sure to set your `.bash_profile` file by following the instructions listed in the [nvm repository](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
	- `brew install yarn`
	- `brew install mongo`
	- `brew install heroku/brew/heroku`
	- `brew install python`
	- `brew install R`

#### Front-end repository:
- For the front-end, run `git clone https://github.com/dali-lab/pine-beetle-frontend`.
- `cd pine-beetle-frontend`. Then make sure you are on the master branch.
- Install necessary packages and dependencies with `yarn install`.


The front-end was scaffolded with Facebook's [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). See below for the following available commands.

##### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

### Front-end Repo Structure

The front-end is built with React.js and deployed with surge. Please contact pine-beetle@dali.dartmouth.edu for access to `.env` files. 

#### Contents
- `src/components` contains all React components.
- `src/styles` contains all CSS.
- `src/assets` contains all images. 
- `build` contains the production build of the site. Deploy from this directory after running `yarn build`

#### Deploying Changes
- The frontend is deployed using surge. Make sure you install it if you don’t already have it: `npm install --global surge`
- Next navigate to `build` and run `yarn build` then `surge --domain [insert domain name here]`. The CNAME file will automatically deploy to `pine-beetle-prediction.surge.sh`, but you must have permissions to deploy to this URL. Use `--domain` to override this and deploy to your own URL.

### Implemented: Fall, 2019
#### Download Button
We added a button to the map on the "Predictive Model" page that allows users to download the currently displayed map as a PDF. When the button is clicked, the current state and year selected in the dropdowns above the map will be displayed in the downloaded map and used to name the file. Currently, the only data that can be downloaded is the probability of any spots occuring in the selected states. This is reflected in the downloaded PDF title.

The button itself is implemented as a mapbox control, which is added to the map in line 110 of `PredictiveMap.js` and is created in the `DownloadControl` function in the same file. When this button is clicked, it calls the `downloadMap` function written in `PredictiveMap.js` which makes necessary design changes to the existing map (adding county names, hiding city names, changing outline widths), uses a library ([mapbox-print-pdf](https://github.com/Eddie-Larsson/mapbox-print-pdf)) to download the map, then unmakes the changes so they are not displayed to the user on the website. This function makes use of `buildPrintMap`, `buildHeader`, and `buildFooter` to make the design changes to the map and create the HTML objects for the header and footer of the PDF.

There is a small bug with this approach in that, if the download function takes a long time to run, the design changes briefly display on the website and then are quickly removed from the predictive model map. This could be fixed in the future by storing two separate maps in the react state and making sure that both the website map and the print map are updated on every zoom and dropdown selection change. The `downloadMap` function would then make the design changes to the print map and download the print map without ever changing the map shown on the website. 


### Expected Implementation: Winter, 2020
- Add in a user-flow to display different ranges of probabilities on the map, four steps will have to be accomplished:
	- Add a dropdown next to the year, state, and county dropdowns (in PredictionsSelectionBar.js) that allows the user to select if
they want to see the probability of any spots, over 53 spots, etc.
	- Connect this data to the predictive model and use it to set the “probability” variable to the correct value in line 150 of PredictiveMap.js
	- Make sure that this change appears in the map on the Predictive Model page and change any titles to make the category of the displayed data clear
	- Make sure that the downloaded map’s title reflects the current category in buildMapHeader() in PredictiveMap.js

### Future Directions
This product illustrates the threats facing communities in a visual manner. It is well suited to visualize any epidemic or spreading threat. It could be generalized and implemented for visualizing risk of forest fires, spread of disease, genetic diversity, or any threat that is predictable, has the potential to propagate outward, and displays a set of observable qualities indicating risk. Southern Pine Beetles may be just the beginning to the uses of a tool like this.
