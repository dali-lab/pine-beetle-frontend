					<h2>About the Project</h2>
                    <div class="line"></div>
                    <p>After developing a model at Dartmouth College to predict outbreaks and movements of Southern Pine Beetles, Professor Ayres and Aoki approached Dartmouth’s DALI Lab to design and develop a tool to visualize the trapping data and predictions gathered annually. This project aimes to deploy a product that field researchers, USFS personel, and the general public can use to understand trends in pine beetle movements.</p>

                    <h2>Using the Product</h2>
                    <div class="line"></div>
                    <p>To view the data, navigate to the <strong><em>View Data</em></strong> page. Here users can see graphical representations of the data as well as outbreak predictions and rankings from the statistical model. Use the selection boxes, slicers, and filters to adjust what data you are viewing.
Move the slider in the top menu bar to select a desired date range. You can click the “Current Year” button to view data specific to the current trapping season. In the drop down menus on the top right, select the state and region you would like to view data for. Click the “Update” button to view new graphs and predictions.
Beneath the graphs is a geographic representation of the trapping data from ArcGIS. Adjust the top menu buttons to see data from different ranges and play around with the graph to see changes in recent years. Please see the contact information at right for feature requests.</p>

					<h2>Next Steps</h2>
					<div class="line"></div>
					<p>Moving forward, this tool will show rich data visualizations that allow users to drill into data and understand pine beetle movements in their region. It will also be updated to include a more flexible and fully developed map visualization showing outbreak densities that are more intuitive and easier to understand. Furthermore, this tool will provide spreadsheet visualizations, allowing users to export .csv files to further explore the data. Additionally, the statistical model used to predict Southern Pine Beetle outbreaks will continue to be enhanced and updated to accurately predict pine beetle movements.</p>
					<p>Be sure to come back to this site often to check up on progress being made. We look forward to deploying a product that allows USFS researchers, government agencies, and even the general public to explore changes happening throughout the nation in the near future.</p>
